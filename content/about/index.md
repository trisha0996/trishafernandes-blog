As the domain suggests, my name is Trisha Fernandes and I’m a cloud engineer working in the IT industry since January 2019.
You can find me on LinkedIn, but in summary, I graduated in 2018 with a degree in Computer Hardware and Software Engineering.
Being a cloud engineer, I’m looking to develop my skills, particularly in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and any cloud related technology, and share what I learn along the way.
